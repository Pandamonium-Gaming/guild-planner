# Supabase Exit Plan

## Purpose

This document defines a practical migration plan to remove direct Supabase dependency from the application, including auth replacement, database ownership, and a low-risk cutover path.

## Scope

In scope:

* Replace Supabase Auth with Discord-first auth owned by this app.
* Replace Supabase client data access with app-owned server APIs and a direct Postgres layer.
* Migrate operational tooling and local/dev environments to Docker Compose.
* Preserve existing behaviour for permissions, group membership, character ownership, and auditability.

Critical execution rule:

* The migration target must support a fully containerized runtime where `app` and `db` are started together via Docker Compose.
* Supabase exit work must include a reproducible data-migration path from Supabase Postgres into the containerized Postgres target.

Out of scope for initial migration:

* Feature redesign.
* Large UI refactors unrelated to auth/data ownership.
* Immediate storage redesign unless required by bucket/file dependencies.

## Current Baseline (Phase 0 Discovery)

Findings from repository inspection:

* Supabase is deeply coupled in app/runtime code and tests (200+ direct references in `src` were observed before search output cap).
* Supabase environment usage appears across runtime and scripts (42 references to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE*` / `SUPABASE_*` across source/docs/scripts/config).
* Existing migrations are in `supabase/migrations/` and include Discord ID migration + RLS policy evolution.
* Current auth and ownership model already uses Discord-linked identity fields, which lowers auth migration risk.

Key existing assets that reduce risk:

* Discord ID strategy is already documented and validated in `docs/DISCORD_ID_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`.
* Existing DB shape and entities are documented in `docs/DATABASE_ERD.md`.

## Target Architecture

### Auth

* Auth.js (NextAuth) with Discord provider.
* Session strategy:
  * Preferred: database sessions for revocation and admin control.
  * Alternative: JWT sessions if operational simplicity is prioritized.
* Canonical identity mapping:
  * Internal user ID (UUID) for app relations.
  * Discord ID as immutable external identity.

### Data

* App-owned Postgres connection (no client-side direct DB access).
* ORM/query layer:
  * Preferred: Prisma for ecosystem maturity and migration ergonomics.
  * Alternative: Drizzle for lighter runtime and SQL-first control.
* Server-only data access from API routes/server actions.

### Runtime/Operations

* Docker Compose for local/dev stack:
  * `app` (Next.js)
  * `db` (Postgres)
  * Optional: `redis`, `PgAdmin`/`adminer`
* Structured migrations via ORM migration tooling.

## Migration Strategy (Phased)

### Phase 0: Decision + Contract (now)

Goals:

* Lock technology choices.
* Define migration contract boundaries.
* Define acceptance criteria for cutover readiness.

Deliverables:

* Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for auth/session and ORM choice.
  * `docs/adr/ADR-001-auth-session-strategy.md` (accepted)
  * `docs/adr/ADR-002-orm-and-migration-strategy.md` (accepted)
* Identity contract (`users.id`, `users.discord_id`, session claims).
* Initial domain boundaries for repository/service interfaces.

### Identity and Session Contract

Canonical identity:

* `users.id` (UUID): internal, relational primary identity used by app tables and FK links.
* `users.discord_id` (string or bigint-normalized string): immutable external identity from Discord.
* `users.discord_id` must be unique globally.

Session contract (Auth.js, DB sessions):

* Session lookup key: Auth.js session token (database-backed).
* Required server session fields:
  * `user.id` (UUID)
  * `user.discordId`
  * `user.displayName` (nullable)
* Optional derived claims (resolved server-side per request or short-lived cache):
  * `activeGroupId`
  * `groupRole` (`admin|officer|member|trial|pending`)

Authorization contract:

* Authorization decisions are server-owned and must not rely solely on client claims.
* Group role checks are resolved from authoritative DB state (`group_members`) for protected operations.
* Discord identity is used for account linking and resilience; internal UUID remains FK source of truth.

Session lifecycle:

* Session creation: after successful Discord OAuth callback and user link/upsert.
* Session revocation: supported via DB session invalidation (global or targeted).
* Role-change propagation: protected endpoints must resolve role from DB at request time or bounded cache TTL.

Data invariants:

* Every authenticated principal maps to exactly one `users.id`.
* `users.discord_id` uniqueness is enforced at DB level.
* No domain table should depend on Discord OAuth token persistence.

### Phase 1: Abstraction Seam

* Introduce app-owned interfaces for auth/data operations.
* Keep Supabase implementation behind adapters temporarily.
* Convert direct component/hook dependencies to call domain services.

### Phase 2: Parallel Backend

* Implement Discord auth via Auth.js.
* Stand up Compose Postgres and ORM models/migrations.
* Implement first server API endpoints with app-owned authorization checks.

### Phase 3: Data Migration + Validation

* Export/import schema and data to app-owned Postgres.
* Validate counts and integrity (PK/FK/unique constraints).
* Optionally dual-read/dual-write for high-risk domains.

### Phase 4: Incremental Cutover

* Migrate domain by domain (auth, permissions, characters, events, etc.).
* Move hooks/components to app endpoints.
* Monitor and validate behaviour parity.

### Phase 5: Decommission Supabase

* Remove direct client dependency and env vars.
* Remove Supabase-specific runtime flows and scripts.
* Keep archived migration history for audit/rollback documentation.

## Phase 0 Tracker (Started)

Status key: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` complete.

* `[~]` Inventory Supabase coupling and env dependencies.
* `[x]` Choose auth/session strategy (Auth.js DB sessions vs JWT) - ADR-001 accepted.
* `[x]` Choose ORM/migration tool (Prisma vs Drizzle) - ADR-002 accepted.
* `[x]` Define identity and authorization contract.
* `[x]` Define first migration slice (auth + permissions read path).
* `[x]` Define rollback strategy and go/no-go criteria.
* `[x]` Create dated Phase 1 checklist with PR sequence (`docs/PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md`).

## Phase 0 Decision Matrix

### 1) Auth/session

Option A: Auth.js + DB sessions (recommended)

* Pros: revocation, admin control, easier incident response.
* Cons: session table management and slightly more DB load.

Option B: Auth.js + JWT sessions

* Pros: simpler infra and fewer DB writes.
* Cons: harder revocation and role update propagation.

### 2) ORM/migrations

Option A: Prisma (recommended)

* Pros: strong ecosystem, migration workflow, good type-safety for teams.
* Cons: heavier generated client and occasional migration verbosity.

Option B: Drizzle

* Pros: lightweight, SQL-first clarity.
* Cons: team familiarity and migration ergonomics vary by workflow.

## Proposed Initial Defaults (to confirm)

* Auth: Auth.js + Discord provider + DB sessions.
* DB: Postgres in Docker Compose for local/dev.
* Data layer: Prisma + server-side repository/services.
* Cutover style: incremental, domain-by-domain (no big-bang rewrite).

## Acceptance Criteria for Completing Phase 0

* Technology choices are explicitly approved.
* Identity/session contract is documented.
* First migration slice is selected and sized.
* Risk register includes top 5 migration risks and mitigations.
* A dated Phase 1 implementation checklist exists.

## Risks and Mitigations

1. Auth parity regressions

* Mitigation: preserve Discord ID mapping and create parity tests around login, membership checks, and role resolution.

1. Authorization drift without RLS

* Mitigation: centralize authorization in server services and add role-based integration tests.

1. Data migration integrity

* Mitigation: scripted verification (counts, orphan checks, unique constraints, FK checks).

1. Feature freeze pressure

* Mitigation: incremental vertical slices with short-lived branch flags.

1. Test suite churn

* Mitigation: replace Supabase chain mocks with service-level test doubles gradually.

## Suggested First Slice (Phase 1 Candidate)

* Auth/session bootstrap.
* Group permissions read endpoint.
* Current-user profile read endpoint.

Reason: this validates identity + authorization early and unlocks downstream domain migration safely.

### First Slice Definition (Locked)

Scope boundaries:

* In scope:
  * Discord login callback and app-owned session issuance.
  * Current authenticated user profile read.
  * Group permission read for current user in active group.
* Out of scope:
  * Writes to recruitment/events/builds domains.
  * Bulk data migration and dual-write.
  * Storage/bucket migration.

Proposed endpoints and handlers:

* `GET /api/auth/session`
  * Returns normalized session payload (`user.id`, `user.discordId`, display fields).
* `GET /api/me/profile`
  * Returns app profile record for authenticated user.
* `GET /api/groups/:groupId/permissions`
  * Returns resolved role + effective permissions for authenticated user in group.

Service/repository modules to introduce:

* `src/server/auth/session-service.ts`
* `src/server/users/user-profile-repository.ts`
* `src/server/permissions/group-permissions-service.ts`

Consumer cutover targets (first slice):

* `useAuth` and auth callback flow.
* Existing permissions read path used by settings/admin gating.
* Current-user profile reads in app shell and settings surfaces.

Effort sizing (engineering days):

* Auth.js bootstrap + Discord provider wiring: 1.0-1.5 days.
* Session and profile endpoint implementation: 1.0 day.
* Group permissions endpoint + role resolution parity tests: 1.0-1.5 days.
* Hook/client integration and cleanup for slice: 1.0 day.
* Total estimated first-slice effort: 4.0-5.0 days.

Test plan and parity checks:

* Unit:
  * Session normalization and identity mapping.
  * Permission resolution for each role (`admin|officer|member|trial|pending`).
* Integration:
  * Authenticated and unauthenticated access for all three endpoints.
  * Group mismatch and non-member scenarios return expected status.
* Regression/parity:
  * Compare outputs against current Supabase-backed path for a fixed fixture dataset.

Go/no-go criteria for slice cutover:

* Go:
  * All new endpoint tests pass.
  * Existing `yarn lint` and `yarn test --runInBand` pass.
  * Role/permission parity matches baseline fixtures in all supported roles.
  * No increase in auth-related error rate during staged rollout window.
* No-go:
  * Any role mismatch causing privilege escalation or unexpected denial.
  * Session invalidation/revocation does not take effect immediately.
  * Repeated 401/403 spikes after enabling slice path.

Rollback strategy for first slice:

* Keep a runtime feature flag (example: `AUTH_STACK=v1|v2`) for endpoint/router selection.
* On failure, switch reads back to Supabase-backed auth/permission path.
* Preserve new tables/sessions for diagnostics; do not run destructive rollback migrations during incident response.
* Require post-rollback incident note with failed criteria and remediation tasks before reattempt.

## PR-06: Runtime Decoupling Sprint (Next)

Goal:

* Remove remaining high-impact direct Supabase runtime usage from client hooks/components and route all reads and writes through app-owned API services.

Scope:

* In scope:
  * Replace direct client-side Supabase auth/session reads in hooks and UI entry points.
  * Replace direct client-side Supabase data mutations in high-impact domains.
  * Define API parity checks for each migrated surface.
* Out of scope:
  * Full data-store replacement in one PR.
  * Bulk schema migration cutover.

Acceptance criteria:

* No direct `@/lib/supabase` imports remain in priority PR-06 target surfaces.
* Equivalent API endpoints exist for each replaced read/write path.
* A runnable Compose profile exists for app + Postgres (`docker-compose.stack.yml`) with documented env bootstrap.
* A documented migration runbook exists for Supabase -> containerized Postgres (file-based export/import).
* `yarn build`, `yarn lint`, and `yarn test --runInBand --silent` pass.
* Feature-flag fallback behavior remains available where required.

### Supabase Coupling Inventory (Current)

Observed runtime coupling areas (non-test sources):

* Client/runtime imports of `@/lib/supabase` remain widespread across hooks, components, app pages, and library actions.
* Server/API routes still initialize Supabase clients for service-role and anon token bridge operations.

Priority extraction buckets for PR-06:

1. Auth/session client coupling
   * Examples:
     * `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
     * `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
     * `src/app/page.tsx`
2. High-impact data hooks (read/write)
   * Examples:
     * `src/hooks/useGroupData.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useEvents.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useGroupMembership.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useBuilds.ts`
3. Settings and admin UI mutations
   * Examples:
     * `src/components/settings/RecruitmentSettings.tsx`
     * `src/components/settings/GroupDiscordSettings.tsx`
     * `src/components/settings/ClanSettings.tsx`
4. Game operations and logistics domains
   * Examples:
     * `src/hooks/useGuildBank.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useLootSystem.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useCaravans.ts`
     * `src/hooks/useFreeholds.ts`

### PR-06 Implementation Sequence

1. Create API-first contract list for each priority bucket.
2. Migrate auth/session calls to API session endpoints only.
3. Migrate group/member/event/settings mutation paths to API-only calls.
4. Add a containerized `app + db` runtime profile and baseline env template.
5. Add Supabase -> containerized Postgres migration runbook steps (dump to file, restore from file).
6. Add or extend integration tests for migrated endpoints.
7. Remove obsolete direct Supabase imports in touched surfaces.
8. Re-run gate checks and record parity outcomes.

### PR-06 Exit Checklist

* \[ ] Priority auth/session surfaces no longer call `supabase.auth.*` on client.
* \[ ] Priority mutation surfaces use API routes only under v2 path.
* \[ ] Endpoint parity tests updated and passing.
* \[ ] Containerized stack profile (`app + db`) runs end-to-end.
* \[ ] Supabase -> containerized Postgres migration runbook is documented and validated on sample data.
* \[ ] Build, lint, translations, and changelog checks pass.
* \[ ] Rollout notes updated in `docs/PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md` (or follow-on phase tracker).

### Containerized Migration Runbook (PR-06)

Use file-based export/import to move data from Supabase Postgres to the containerized Postgres stack.

Safety rules:

* Do not perform direct source->target streaming writes.
* Always export to a local file first, then restore from file.

Example flow (PowerShell):

1. Start stack.

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.stack.example .env.stack
docker compose -f docker-compose.stack.yml up --build -d
```

1. Export from Supabase Postgres to file.

```powershell
pg_dump "<SUPABASE_POSTGRES_URL>" --data-only --no-owner --no-privileges --file supabase-data.sql
```

1. Restore into containerized Postgres.

```powershell
Get-Content supabase-data.sql | docker exec -i guild-planner-db psql -U postgres -d guild_planner
```

1. Validate target data.

```powershell
docker exec -it guild-planner-db psql -U postgres -d guild_planner -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM groups;"
docker exec -it guild-planner-db psql -U postgres -d guild_planner -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM members;"
```

1. Run app gates against stack.

```powershell
yarn build
yarn lint
yarn test --runInBand --silent
```

## Next Actions

1. Execute PR-06 Sequence step 1 by publishing API-first contract list per priority bucket.
2. Implement PR-06 step 2 (auth/session client decoupling) as the first commit slice.
3. Run parity tests and staged rollout checks after each bucket migration.
